									Some of the police were to go around peeking through windows to see if they could catch anyone
									breaking the law. If an interracial couple got caught, they would kick down the door, drag the people
									out, beat them and arrest them. But they would only do that to the black person. The police would
									always favor the white person and let them go scot-free while the African would pay the
									price.<br></br>
								</p>

								<p>
									Trevor describes South Africa as a police state. He defined it by saying that in the state, everyone thinks
									everyone else is the police.The police had recruited some people, in this case he specified that it was
									black people, who were acting as spies to aid the police in catching the law breakers.
									He goes on to say that even when they were walking in the street with his mother, she would have to
									drop him as soon as the police came because they lived in an area that was highly populated by
									Europeans and they wouldn&#39;t have believed that she was his mother.<br></br>

									In the white areas you rarely saw the police and if you did it was officer friendly while in Soweto the
									police were an occupying army. They were militarized. Someone was always marching or protesting
									somewhere and had to be suppressed.<br></br>
									
								</p>

								<p>
									Trevor says he&#39;d hear gunshots, screams and tear gas being fired
									in the air. The police would even take the wrong-color kids in the wrong color area; If you
									were black in a white people area, you were taken, and vice-versa.

								<p>
									In Kenya, many times we see the police going after
									protesters in a violent manner. They are always heavily armed to suppress the protesters and more often,Gunshots and
									tear gas are always fired in the air to control the crowd but instead it cultivates hate
									and anger between the people and the crowd.<br></br>

								</p>
								
								<p>
									The police in Kenya are friendly with the citizens and not many cases of arrests
									because of one&#39;s race have been reported.<br></br>
									In the slums like Kibera,you will often find the police are heavily armed and are always on watch
									especially during times like the general elections but in the suburbs you rarely find the police harassing
									people for no reason.
