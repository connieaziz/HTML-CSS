<h1>painful story</h1>

<p class="panel">

 saddens my heart that everytime i try showing love to someone i always end up  recieving a slap on my face!
 it's such a tideous job trying to always blend in with people who are "not of your standard!"
 at times you wonder,what is this "standard"all about?Beats me to think about it,perharps it's all about the luxurious stuffs people have,or perharps the many foreign friends they have?!

</p>

 <p class="test">

 at times i vow to never pay much attention on anyone and everyone,and just keep everything to myself,but then my fragile vulnerable heart doesn't show me mercy when it comes to that.it's unhealthy to give so much expecting the same to be offered to you!some ask,"why care so much about people and less about yourself?"others ask,"why torture yourself loving people that much??!"Honest answer,i don't know why,i just know when i love,i love for real,and unconditionally,the same way when i decide to drop you,not even my fragile heart will talk me out of that!!!

</p>

<p class="left">

 am too easy to manipulate and too tough to forgive!!!i am a hard core,yes,but i try to just be like a normal human,still i see it's not paying nor adding any benefit to my life.i finally realize the hard way that it doesn't matter how much effort or less effort you put out there to prove your worth in someone's life,no one cares and no one appreciates,it's time to revive my characters,for the good of my heart,i just have to understand that no one was born to make me happy.You don't love the characters of many different people,you love the many different characters in one person.
