<h1>UNTITLED</h1>
<p>
<br>If I could give you one thing in life,I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes,only then would you realize how special you are to me.If you were a movie,I would watch you countless times,if loving you was a job,I would be the most deserving,dedicated and qualified candidate.infact,I would even be willing to work for free!<br>
</p>
<p>
<br> Your smile is literaly among the cutest things I have ever seen in my life.If I was asked to describe you in just two words,I would say,"Simply Amazing"You do a million little things that bring joy to my life.I know fairy tales come true because I have you,there are only two times that I want to be with you,"Now" and "Forever".</br>

<p>
<br>Your voice is my favorite melody.Since the time I met you,I have cried a little less,laughed a little harder and smiled all the more.My life is in a better place because I have you,and every day with you is a wonderful edition to my journey.Sometimes I just think back to the first time I laid my eyes on you,i knew right then that I had found someone incredible.No matter how dark my day is,seeing you always brightens it and makes me realize that with you am doing right.<br>
</p>
	
<p>
<br>The only time I stupidly smile is when I get text messages from you.Nobody is perfect,but you are so close and it is scary!All I need is you right here with me.I love you more than yesterday but not more than I will tomorrow.<br>
