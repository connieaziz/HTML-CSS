    	<h1>MY BIO</h1>
    	<p>I have nothing to write about myself.Because all has been said by everyone I have come in contact with.But what I do know is I appreciate myself and the fact that I Never give up however hard situations may be.I know am ambitious even though at times I feel am not.Am too adictive and a charmer,which at times leads me into trouble,but such is life.</p>
    	<p>I tend to care too much that people think I am obsessive,but what they forget is I ahuman,and I have limits to everything!What I love most is that I always get what I want,through the easy or the hard way.I believe in hard work and independence,am obsessed about responsibilities and being the head in what i do.</p>
    	<p>I realized am weird because while people are thinking about how to make lots of cash for whatever reasons they have,i always think about how i'll get myself a well paying,time-friendly job so i can buy a simple family house then put up businesses and buy plots,and,save up for my children's future</p>
    	<p>I love me because i always do me and i do not appreciate being pressured!My work is always a job well done when i do it at my own tie,own my own free will.Someone might think i am dumb and boring,which is true,but the real reason is i talk when and where necessary,and i do not engage in non productive arguments!</p>
    	<p>I at times feel am God's angel sent to earth,because i feel i change people's lives for the better,..well,some ofcause.</p>
    	<p>I love my life,and everyone who's been in it,who are in it and who'll be in it.Am hopping to change the lives of as many girls as i can,and be the best wife and mother to my family.</p>
